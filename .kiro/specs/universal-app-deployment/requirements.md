# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing Next.js TypeScript codebase (charge-tn-ui) into a universal application that can deploy to web, iOS, and Android platforms using a single shared codebase. The solution will implement Capacitor 5+ as the native wrapper while maintaining the existing Next.js 14+ web functionality, enabling cross-platform deployment with platform-specific optimizations and conditional logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain a single codebase that can build for web, iOS, and Android platforms, so that I can reduce development overhead and ensure feature parity across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build system is configured THEN the system SHALL support three distinct build targets: web (Next.js SSR/SSG), iOS (Capacitor), and Android (Capacitor)
2. WHEN building for web THEN the system SHALL use standard Next.js build process with dynamic imports and server-side rendering capabilities
3. WHEN building for mobile platforms THEN the system SHALL generate static exports compatible with Capacitor wrapper
4. WHEN code is shared between platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain 90%+ code reuse across web and mobile builds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want runtime platform detection and conditional logic, so that I can provide platform-specific functionality while maintaining code cohesion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL detect whether it's running in a native Capacitor environment or web browser
2. WHEN platform-specific APIs are needed THEN the system SHALL conditionally import and use appropriate implementations (Capacitor plugins vs web APIs)
3. WHEN rendering UI components THEN the system SHALL apply platform-specific styling and behavior adaptations
4. IF the platform is native THEN the system SHALL use Capacitor plugins for device features
5. IF the platform is web THEN the system SHALL use standard web APIs and fallbacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dual build system configuration, so that I can optimize builds for each target platform while sharing common code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the build system THEN the system SHALL support separate build configurations for web and native targets
2. WHEN building for web THEN the system SHALL use Next.js with SSR/SSG capabilities and dynamic imports
3. WHEN building for native THEN the system SHALL generate static HTML/CSS/JS files compatible with Capacitor
4. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL share common components, utilities, and business logic between all targets
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL handle platform-specific dependencies through conditional imports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Capacitor 5+ for native mobile deployment, so that I can access native device features and deploy to app stores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Capacitor is integrated THEN the system SHALL support iOS and Android project generation
2. WHEN native features are accessed THEN the system SHALL use Capacitor plugins for device APIs (camera, storage, geolocation, etc.)
3. WHEN building for mobile THEN the system SHALL generate native app bundles ready for app store deployment
4. WHEN the app runs on mobile THEN the system SHALL have access to native device capabilities through Capacitor bridge

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations and API handling, so that I can manage different endpoints and behaviors across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL load appropriate configuration based on the target platform
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate HTTP clients and error handling
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use Capacitor Preferences for native apps and localStorage/sessionStorage for web
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL adapt authentication flows for each platform's capabilities
5. IF the platform supports it THEN the system SHALL use native authentication methods (biometrics, keychain)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing functionality while adding universal deployment, so that current features continue to work across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the universal system is implemented THEN all existing Next.js features SHALL continue to function on web
2. WHEN components are adapted THEN existing UI components (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS) SHALL work on all platforms
3. WHEN state management is used THEN existing Zustand stores SHALL function consistently across platforms
4. WHEN API integrations are maintained THEN existing services (Firebase, Google Maps, etc.) SHALL work with platform-appropriate implementations
5. WHEN testing is performed THEN existing Jest test suites SHALL continue to pass with platform-aware test configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized performance for each platform, so that users get the best experience regardless of their device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web version loads THEN the system SHALL leverage Next.js optimizations (code splitting, image optimization, SSR)
2. WHEN the mobile version loads THEN the system SHALL use static assets optimized for native performance
3. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement platform-appropriate caching strategies
4. WHEN animations are used THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms and native-optimized animations
5. WHEN bundle size is analyzed THEN mobile builds SHALL exclude server-side only dependencies
