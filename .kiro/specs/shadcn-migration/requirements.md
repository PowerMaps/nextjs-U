# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completing the migration to shadcn/ui design system for the existing Next.js application. The project already has a partial shadcn/ui setup with Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, and some UI components, but needs to be fully migrated to ensure consistency, proper configuration, and complete component coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete shadcn/ui setup, so that I can use consistent, accessible, and well-designed components throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shadcn/ui CLI is properly configured THEN the system SHALL allow adding new components via `npx shadcn@latest add [component]`
2. WHEN components.json configuration exists THEN the system SHALL define proper paths for components, utils, and styling
3. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN all shadcn/ui components SHALL be properly organized in the designated components directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing UI components to follow shadcn/ui patterns, so that the codebase maintains consistency and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing UI components are reviewed THEN they SHALL follow shadcn/ui component patterns and structure
2. WHEN utility functions are used THEN they SHALL use the proper shadcn/ui utilities like `cn()` function
3. WHEN components are styled THEN they SHALL use the shadcn/ui design tokens and CSS variables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support for shadcn/ui components, so that I get full type safety and IntelliSense support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript configuration is checked THEN it SHALL include proper path mappings for shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN importing components THEN TypeScript SHALL provide full type checking and autocomplete
3. WHEN using component props THEN they SHALL be properly typed according to shadcn/ui specifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing essential shadcn/ui components to be available, so that I can build complete user interfaces without custom implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common UI patterns are needed THEN essential shadcn/ui components SHALL be available (form, table, sheet, etc.)
2. WHEN components are added THEN they SHALL be properly configured with the project's theme and styling
3. WHEN new components are installed THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the global CSS to be properly configured for shadcn/ui, so that the design system works correctly across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN shadcn/ui CSS variables SHALL be properly defined and available
2. WHEN dark/light mode is toggled THEN the theme SHALL switch correctly using shadcn/ui color tokens
3. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL use the correct base styles and animations
