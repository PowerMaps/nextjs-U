# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the integration between the dashboard views and API responses to ensure all views display real data from API endpoints instead of mock data. The current implementation has several TypeScript errors and data structure mismatches that need to be resolved to provide a seamless user experience with accurate, real-time data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all dashboard views to display real data from API responses, so that I can see accurate and up-to-date information about my vehicles, wallet, routes, and notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the dashboard page THEN the system SHALL display real data from API endpoints for vehicles, wallet, transactions, routes, and notifications
2. WHEN API data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages
4. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL show appropriate empty states with actionable next steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification system to work correctly with paginated responses, so that I can see all my notifications properly formatted and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view notifications THEN the system SHALL correctly handle paginated notification responses
2. WHEN I have unread notifications THEN the system SHALL display the correct count and highlight unread items
3. WHEN I interact with notifications THEN the system SHALL properly update read status and refresh the display
4. WHEN notifications are filtered or searched THEN the system SHALL work with the paginated data structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the map view to correctly integrate with charging station and route APIs, so that I can plan routes and find charging stations with accurate real-time data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the map view THEN the system SHALL display charging stations with correct location coordinates and status
2. WHEN I calculate a route THEN the system SHALL use real vehicle data and return accurate route information
3. WHEN I view nearby stations THEN the system SHALL show stations with proper status indicators and connector information
4. WHEN I interact with address autocomplete THEN the system SHALL properly handle coordinate conversion and location selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all data types to be properly typed and validated, so that the application is stable and provides accurate information without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads data THEN the system SHALL properly type all API responses according to the defined interfaces
2. WHEN data is displayed THEN the system SHALL handle optional fields gracefully without causing errors
3. WHEN data structures change THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety and provide clear error messages
4. WHEN components receive data THEN the system SHALL validate data shapes and provide fallbacks for missing properties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling and loading states across all views, so that I have a predictable and professional user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL show consistent loading indicators
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN data is empty THEN the system SHALL show helpful empty states with guidance on next actions
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
