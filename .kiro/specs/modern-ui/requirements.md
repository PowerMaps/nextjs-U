# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a modern, ergonomic UI using Next.js and TypeScript that will effectively interface with the existing project APIs. The UI will provide an intuitive and responsive interface for users to interact with the system's functionality, with a focus on performance, accessibility, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core UI Framework and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Next.js and TypeScript project structure that integrates with the existing backend API, so that I can build a modern UI with type safety and server-side rendering capabilities.

2. WHEN initializing the project THEN the system SHALL configure proper ESLint and Prettier settings for code quality
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL implement a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
4. WHEN connecting to backend APIs THEN the system SHALL use type-safe API client generation
5. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration

### Requirement 2: Authentication and User Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate and manage my profile in the system, so that I can access personalized features and maintain my account information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL provide login and registration functionality
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain secure session management
3. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display user-specific information and options
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully
5. IF a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide password recovery functionality

### Requirement 3: Routing and Navigation Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access routing and navigation features through an intuitive interface, so that I can plan routes, view station information, and analyze route options efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests route planning THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map interface
2. WHEN a user selects origin and destination points THEN the system SHALL calculate and display optimal routes
3. WHEN displaying routes THEN the system SHALL show charging stations along the route
4. WHEN a user selects a station THEN the system SHALL display detailed station information
5. WHEN route conditions change THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates to the route

### Requirement 4: Vehicle Management Interface

**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to manage my vehicle information and preferences, so that I can receive personalized routing and charging recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the vehicle section THEN the system SHALL display a list of user's registered vehicles
2. WHEN a user adds a new vehicle THEN the system SHALL collect all necessary vehicle specifications
3. WHEN planning routes THEN the system SHALL consider vehicle-specific parameters
4. WHEN a vehicle's status changes THEN the system SHALL update relevant information in real-time
5. IF a user has multiple vehicles THEN the system SHALL allow switching between vehicles for route planning

### Requirement 5: Weather Integration and Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see weather information integrated with my route planning, so that I can understand how weather conditions might affect my journey and charging needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a route THEN the system SHALL show relevant weather information along the route
2. WHEN weather conditions affect charging efficiency THEN the system SHALL adjust estimated charging times
3. WHEN severe weather is detected THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and alternative recommendations
4. WHEN viewing station details THEN the system SHALL display current and forecasted weather at that location
5. WHEN planning future trips THEN the system SHALL incorporate weather forecasts into route planning

### Requirement 6: Notifications and Alerts

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive timely notifications about relevant events, so that I can stay informed about changes that affect my routes and charging plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opts in to notifications THEN the system SHALL set up browser and/or mobile push notifications
2. WHEN station availability changes THEN the system SHALL notify affected users
3. WHEN weather conditions significantly change THEN the system SHALL send relevant alerts
4. WHEN a user's vehicle completes charging THEN the system SHALL send a notification
5. WHEN the system sends notifications THEN the user SHALL be able to manage notification preferences

### Requirement 7: Data Visualization and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view analytics and visualizations related to my routes and charging history, so that I can make informed decisions about future trips and charging strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics and visualizations
2. WHEN viewing trip history THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics on routes and charging sessions
3. WHEN analyzing charging patterns THEN the system SHALL offer insights and optimization suggestions
4. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL use intuitive charts and graphs
5. WHEN users interact with visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities for detailed information

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and Internationalization

**User Story:** As a diverse user, I want the application to be accessible and available in my preferred language, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities or language preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building UI components THEN the system SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. WHEN designing the interface THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation and screen readers
3. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL support multiple languages through internationalization
4. WHEN users change their language preference THEN the system SHALL persist this setting
5. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL provide alternative indicators for users with color vision deficiencies

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond immediately to my interactions, so that I can efficiently accomplish my tasks without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL optimize initial load time using code splitting
2. WHEN rendering data-heavy components THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization for large lists
3. WHEN fetching data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies
4. WHEN users interact with the UI THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance
5. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 10: Offline Capabilities

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want basic functionality to work even when I have limited or no connectivity, so that I can access critical information during my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loses network connectivity THEN the system SHALL continue to function with cached data
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the offline status to the user
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize data and notify the user
4. WHEN planning routes THEN the system SHALL allow downloading routes for offline use
5. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL queue user actions for processing when connectivity is restored
