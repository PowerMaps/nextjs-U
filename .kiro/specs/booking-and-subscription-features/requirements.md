# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the missing functionality for both connector reservations/bookings and subscription management with upgrade capabilities. The current system has partial implementations for both areas - booking functionality exists but needs completion (availability checking, wallet integration, proper error handling), while subscription functionality has API hooks but lacks user interface components. The goal is to provide users with a seamless experience for both booking charging connectors and managing their subscription plans with upgrade/downgrade options.
